# Welcome to the REST API Adventure!

## Purpose

Ahoy, future web developers! ðŸŒŸ

Welcome aboard the good ship "REST API Adventure," where you'll embark on a thrilling journey to master the art of REST APIs. This project is your treasure map, guiding you through the mysterious seas of database interactions and web application creation. By the end of this voyage, you'll be a seasoned sailor, ready to navigate the vast ocean of real-world scenarios with ease.

This was developed for our Youtube Video [Consuming REST API for Frontend Development](https://youtu.be/Hf8P35GHJ4k)

## What You'll Learn

### 1. The Basics of REST APIs
- **What is a REST API?**: Understand the fundamental concepts and principles behind RESTful services.
- **CRUD Operations**: Master the four essential operations - Create, Read, Update, and Delete - and how they map to HTTP methods.

### 2. Hands-On Examples, because play is the best way to learn.
- **Interacting with a Database**: Learn how to fetch, add, update, and delete data from a database using REST APIs.
- **Building a Web Application**: Use the data retrieved from the database to create a dynamic and interactive web application.

## Project Structure

We've broken down each part of the API CRUD operations into separate files to make your journey smoother:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the database. ([API/get.js](API/get.js))
- **POST**: Add new data to the database. ([API/post.js](API/post.js))
- **PUT**: Update existing data in the database. ([API/put.js](API/put.js))
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the database. ([API/delete.js](API/delete.js))

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Grab your copy of the project and set sail!
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to get all the necessary packages.
3. **Start the Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to launch your local server.
4. **Explore the Code**: Dive into the `API` folder and see how each CRUD operation is implemented.
5. **Experiment and Learn**: Modify the code, break things, fix them, and learn along the way.

## Conclusion

By the end of this adventure, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use REST APIs to interact with a database and create a web application. So, hoist the sails, grab your coding compass, and let's set off on this exciting journey together!

Happy coding, and may the code be with you! ðŸš€
